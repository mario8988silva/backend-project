4. partials/ — small reusable chunks
These are not components, but Blade includes:

_form.blade.php

_table.blade.php

_filters.blade.php

_header.blade.php

Example:

Code
resources/views/products/_form.blade.php
resources/views/users/_filters.blade.php
Use partials when:

it’s not a component

but you want to reuse it across multiple views
